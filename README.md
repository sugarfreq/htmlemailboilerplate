# htmlemailboilerplate

A place to start from for any email coding. 

I've found several outdated html email boiler plate templates that included old fixes that were no longer necessary. This template has been created to include up to date CSS resets (thanks to @JayOram) and maximize accessibility. 

I code using a table based layout using divs as a more of a progressive enhancement to ensure maximum support across email clients.

Two versions are included, one with comments and one without. 

I welcome any suggestions or updates.
